Description: 
    Provides a collection of cellular automata models designed to explore
    neutral and terrain-weighted ecological dynamics on spatial grids.
    The package includes tools for simulating vegetation spread, disturbance,
    and spatial heterogeneity driven by local interactions and environmental
    constraints.
